// Created by Jonathan Leack

This program built using node.js will scrape a prototype website for product details, map the data to an array, and then push to CSV in a sub-folder.

Dependencies include Scrape-It and JSON2CSV. Both are available via npm.

To run this program do the following:

1. Make sure you have 'scraper.js' and 'package.json' in a single folder.
2. From command line, type 'npm install' to install all dependencies.
3. Type 'npm start' to run the program. Alternatively, you can manually run the program by typing 'node scraper.js'.
